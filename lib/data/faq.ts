    question: 'Is this morbid?',
    answer: 'Is writing a letter morbid? Recording your voice is an act of love, not death. Most members record for birthdays, graduations, and "just because" moments.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I don\'t know what to say?',
    answer: 'Our Conversation Guides help with gentle prompts. Start simple: "What I love about you," "My favorite memory," or "Always remember."'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can their voice speak new words of love?',
    answer: 'Yes. Upload existing recordings—voicemails, videos, voice memos—and let their voice continue offering comfort. They can wish happy birthdays, give advice, and share love for moments they couldn\'t predict. It\'s their authentic voice pattern speaking from the heart.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if they\'ve already passed?',
    answer: 'It\'s never too late. If you have recordings of their voice, we can help it bloom again. Many families find deep comfort hearing dad answer questions they never got to ask, or grandma reading bedtime stories to grandchildren she never met.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Who can access my recordings?',
    answer: 'Only the recipients you choose. You control everything—who, what, and when.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens to my recordings after...?',
    answer: 'Your designated Grove Keeper manages your legacy according to your wishes. We\'re custodians, not owners.'
