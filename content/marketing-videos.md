## VOICE RESTORATION CAMPAIGN STRATEGY

### Messaging Architecture

**Two Pathways to Memory Grove:**

1. **Prevention Path** (Original Videos 1-3)
   - "Record while you can"
   - Prevents future regret
   - Active legacy building
   - Primary CTA: "Start recording today"

2. **Restoration Path** (New Videos 4-6)
   - "Their voice can continue"
   - Heals current grief
   - Transforms existing recordings
   - Primary CTA: "Upload their recordings"

### Emotional Journey Mapping

**Recognition Phase:**
- "I wish I could hear them again" → "You can"
- "I never asked about..." → "You still can"
- "My kids won't know them" → "They will"

**Transformation Phase:**
- Old voicemails → New conversations
- Static memories → Dynamic presence
- Past recordings → Future moments

**Legacy Phase:**
- One generation → Infinite generations
- Limited messages → Unlimited wisdom
- Final goodbye → Eternal hello

### Platform-Specific Strategy

**TikTok/Reels (15-30 sec versions):**
- Focus on reveal moment (voice restoration working)
- "POV: You can talk to grandma again"
- Quick emotional hit

**YouTube (Full versions + testimonials):**
- Complete story arcs
- Behind-the-scenes: "How voice restoration works"
- Real family testimonials

**Facebook/LinkedIn:**
- Target sandwich generation (caring for parents + kids)
- Emphasize legacy and wisdom preservation
- Professional approach for end-of-life planners

### Addressing Concerns Proactively

**"Is it real?"**
- "Their actual voice patterns"
- "Like they're speaking from the heart"
- Show original vs. restored comparison

**"Is it creepy?"**
- Focus on love, not technology
- Use warm, natural settings
- Show families finding comfort

**"Is it ethical?"**
- Emphasize consent and family control
- Position as honoring their memory
- "What would they want to say?"

### Key Differentiators from Original Campaign

1. **Hope over Urgency:** "It's never too late" vs. "Before it's too late"
2. **Healing over Prevention:** Address current grief, not just future loss
3. **Continuation over Preservation:** Living voice vs. static recording
4. **Expansion over Limitation:** Infinite conversations vs. finite messages

### Success Metrics

- Comments asking "How do I upload recordings?"
- Shares with personal stories
- Saves for later consideration

- Track "Upload" vs. "Record" path conversions
- Time from view to sign-up
- Which video drives most valuable users
